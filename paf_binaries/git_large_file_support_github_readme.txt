Github and Git have a large file size limit of 50MB as of July 29, 2021 so instead

it is better to just get the paf.exe files in releases (https://github.com/hoabut/ChiaNetworkMainnetPortable/releases) or at:

https://www.tagswitch.com/development/apps/portableapps/chianetworkmainnetportable/ChiaNetworkMainnetPortable_1.2.2_Dev_Test_1.paf.exe
