Github and Git have a large file size limit of 50MB as of July 29, 2021 so instead
having to go through Git Large File Storage support at https://git-lfs.github.com/
it is better to just get the PortableApps.com Format templates and sources files in releases (https://github.com/hoabut/ChiaNetworkMainnetPortable/releases) or at:
